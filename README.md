# Expense Tracker Application

This is a simple Expense Tracker application built with React. It allows users to:

- **View Expenses:** See a table displaying a list of their recorded expenses.
- **Add New Expenses:** Fill out a form to add new expenses to the table (data is not persisted).
- **Filter Expenses:** Search and filter expenses based on their name, description, or category.
- **Sort Expenses:** Sort expenses alphabetically by category or description.
- **Delete Expenses:** Remove specific expenses from the table.

## Features

**Core Deliverables:**

- **Expense Table:** Displays a list of expenses with details like name, description, category, amount, and date.
- **Add Expense Form:** A user-friendly form to input details for new expenses. Upon submission, the new expense is added to the table.
- **Search Functionality:** A search bar that filters the displayed expenses based on matching text in the name, description, or category.

**Advanced Deliverables:**

- **Sorting:** Buttons to sort the expenses alphabetically by "Category" or "Description". An "active" state visually indicates the current sorting method, and a "Clear Sort" button is available to remove sorting.
- **Delete Expense:** Each expense row in the table has a "Delete" button to remove that specific expense.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **CSS:** For styling the application.
